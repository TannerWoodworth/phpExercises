        // EXERCISE: Use the factory design pattern to create an abstracted set of data manipulation functions. Think of this as similar to a database abstraction layer that supports multiple connection types. In this case, however, the source for the data is either a PDO connection of a fictitious REST resource. These methods should be able to be used without any knowledge of which data type is being retrieved from the factory.
