		// EXERCISE: Create a simple routing mechanism that takes a request like: '/foo/bar' and translates it to 'FooControllerÂ­>barAction();'' This exercise assumes a single script as an access point to load these controller classes and action methods. Do not use any external frameworks or libraries to accomplish this task.
